### Introduction

The Mustangpeak program **UltraExplorer** was originally developed by **Jim 
Kueneman** and contains the CommonLIB, EasyListView, VirutalShellExplorer and EasyNSE components.

Mustangpeak **UltraExplorer** (including the NG releases) provides Windows Explorer style shell by using MustangPeak's Treeview, Listview and
VirtualShellTools component libraries for Delphi and C++Builder.

The source code in this repository is retrieved from [Magenta System's](https://magsys.co.uk) SVN server, which is suited
to version v2.5.3.1

Currently is this repository a source-only release of UltraExplorer till there is a **G00D** working version.\

It doesn't include all libraries in this repository, because you can grap them from the given links from this readme.\

UltraExplorer 3rd live should be redesigned with **RAD STUDIO Athens and/or later versions will be supported.**
At first, a working Win32 version should be redesigned / created, ***and in the future a Win64 version***.

### Required Libraries

Please install **all** MustangPeakNG libraries in **this order:**

1.	[VirtualTreeView](https://github.com/JAM-Software/Virtual-TreeView) by JAM-Software or from\
		[VirtualTreeView](https://github.com/TurboPack/Virtual-TreeView) by TurboPack.\
		Warning: The Virtual-Treeview library from JAM-Software and TurboPack are two different repositories and their
		lives, I prefer to use repository from JAM-Software which is the most compatible component library.
